To run the project, simple execute the command:

$ python main.py

Once you're in main.py, you get the list of options available (batch training, batch testing, online mode, etc.)
We've also included the 'indexdir' and 'mydb' in the submitted project, so that our project can be run without having
to fill the BD and Whoosh all over again (which in our PCs takes about 3h30min.)
